Got it üëç Let‚Äôs structure everything properly.
Here‚Äôs the **Operating System Syllabus for Placements** in a neat **step-by-step structured format** (with hierarchy, so you can track progress like a roadmap):

---

# üìò Operating System Syllabus for Placements

## **1. Basics of OS**

* What is an Operating System?
* Types of OS:

  * Batch
  * Time Sharing
  * Distributed
  * Real-Time
  * Embedded
* Functions of OS:

  * Process Management
  * Memory Management
  * File System
  * I/O Management
  * Security
* System Calls (`fork`, `exec`, `wait`, `exit`, etc.)
* Monolithic vs Microkernel architecture

---

## **2. Processes & Threads**

* Process states & Process Control Block (PCB)
* Context Switching
* Threads vs Processes
* Multi-threading & its advantages
* User-level vs Kernel-level threads

---

## **3. CPU Scheduling**

* Scheduling Algorithms:

  * FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  * SJF (Shortest Job First)
  * Round Robin
  * Priority Scheduling
  * Multilevel Queue Scheduling
* Preemptive vs Non-preemptive scheduling
* Performance metrics:

  * Waiting Time
  * Turnaround Time
  * Throughput

---

## **4. Process Synchronization**

* Race Conditions & Critical Section Problem
* Peterson‚Äôs Algorithm
* Synchronization Tools:

  * Semaphores (binary & counting)
  * Mutex Locks
  * Monitors
* Classic Problems:

  * Producer-Consumer Problem
  * Readers-Writers Problem
  * Dining Philosophers Problem

---

## **5. Deadlocks**

* Coffman‚Äôs Conditions (necessary conditions for deadlock)
* Methods:

  * Deadlock Detection
  * Deadlock Prevention
  * Deadlock Avoidance (Banker‚Äôs Algorithm)
  * Deadlock Recovery

---

## **6. Memory Management**

* Address Binding (Logical vs Physical)
* Contiguous Memory Allocation (Fixed & Variable partitions)
* Paging:

  * Page Table, Page Faults, TLB
  * Multi-level Paging
* Segmentation
* Virtual Memory:

  * Demand Paging
  * Thrashing
* Page Replacement Algorithms:

  * FIFO
  * LRU
  * Optimal
  * Clock

---

## **7. File Systems**

* File Attributes & Operations
* Directory Structures
* File Allocation Methods:

  * Contiguous
  * Linked
  * Indexed
* Free Space Management
* Inodes

---

## **8. I/O Systems**

* I/O Hardware basics
* Disk Scheduling Algorithms:

  * FCFS
  * SSTF
  * SCAN, C-SCAN
  * LOOK
* RAID Levels
* Buffering & Spooling

---

## **9. Advanced Topics (Important for Product Companies)**

* Interprocess Communication (Pipes, Message Queues, Shared Memory)
* OS-level Synchronization in Linux (futex, spinlocks)
* Scheduling in Multi-core systems
* Virtualization (Hypervisor, Containers, Docker)
* Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) basics

---

## **10. Practical & Coding (Very Important)**

* Write Code for:

  * Producer-Consumer using semaphores
  * Reader-Writer Problem
  * Dining Philosophers Problem
  * Page Replacement Algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal)
  * CPU Scheduling Simulation Programs
* System Calls practice (`fork`, `exec`, `wait`, `pipe`)

---

## ‚úÖ **Focus Areas for Product Companies**

* Process, Threads, Synchronization
* Deadlock handling
* Paging & Virtual Memory
* CPU Scheduling Algorithms
* OS + Coding Application

---

üëâ Since you said *"I want to learn it in depth, teach me as a child"*, we‚Äôll cover **each topic slowly with stories, examples, and small coding tasks.**

Do you want me to continue with a **visual diagram (User ‚Üí OS ‚Üí Hardware flow)** for the **Basics of OS** before we move deeper?
