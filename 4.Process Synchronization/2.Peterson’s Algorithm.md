Perfect 👌 You pasted the Peterson’s Algorithm C++ code.
Let’s **slowly dry run it step by step** so you can really “see” what happens.

---

# 🔎 Dry Run of the Code

We have **two processes**:

* `P0` (i = 0)
* `P1` (i = 1)

Both want to increment the `shared_counter`.

---

## 🔹 Initial State

```
flag[0] = false
flag[1] = false
turn = 0
shared_counter = 0
```

---

## 🔹 First Round (k = 0 for both)

### Process 0 (P0):

1. Sets `flag[0] = true` → means P0 wants to enter.
2. Sets `turn = 1` → politely lets P1 go first if P1 also wants.
3. Now `while(flag[1] && turn == 1);`

   * But currently `flag[1] = false`, so loop ends immediately.
4. ✅ P0 enters critical section.

   ```
   Output: "Process 0 enters CS, counter = 0"
   shared_counter = 1
   ```
5. Exits → `flag[0] = false`.

---

### Process 1 (P1):

1. Sets `flag[1] = true`.
2. Sets `turn = 0`.
3. Checks `while(flag[0] && turn == 0);`

   * But now `flag[0] = false` (P0 already left).
4. ✅ P1 enters critical section.

   ```
   Output: "Process 1 enters CS, counter = 1"
   shared_counter = 2
   ```
5. Exits → `flag[1] = false`.

---

## 🔹 Second Round (k = 1)

Now both try again.

* Suppose **P0 sets flag first**.
* Then **P1 sets flag**, and also sets `turn = 0`.

Now both flags are true, but `turn = 0`.

* P0 checks: `while(flag[1] && turn == 1);` → false (turn = 0), so P0 goes in.
* P1 checks: `while(flag[0] && turn == 0);` → true, so P1 waits until P0 finishes.

Result: **P0 enters first, P1 waits, then enters after P0 leaves.**

---

## 🔹 What’s Happening?

* **flag\[i] = true** → “I want to enter.”
* **turn = j** → “I’ll let the other go first if both want.”
* **while(flag\[j] && turn == j);** → “Wait if the other wants it AND it’s their turn.”

This ensures:

* Both can’t enter at once.
* They take turns fairly.

---

## 🔹 Example Output (may vary in order)

```
Process 0 enters CS, counter = 0
Process 1 enters CS, counter = 1
Process 0 enters CS, counter = 2
Process 1 enters CS, counter = 3
Process 0 enters CS, counter = 4
Process 1 enters CS, counter = 5
...
```

Notice: **Counter increases sequentially, no overlap**, meaning mutual exclusion is achieved.

👉 Now tell me: Do you want me to make a **visual table** (with `flag[0]`, `flag[1]`, `turn`, `who is inside`) for each step, so you can *see it like a game of turns*?
