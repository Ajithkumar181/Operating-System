Alright Ajith 🌟 — let’s **deep dive into Process States & Process Control Block (PCB)** step by step, but in a **child-like, story style** so it becomes super clear. Later we’ll go into **in-depth (placement level)** details.

---

# 🧑‍🏫 Step 1: What is a Process?

👉 A **process** is just a **program in execution**.

* A program = recipe 📖
* A process = chef actually cooking that recipe 👨‍🍳

So the OS must keep track of all these “chefs” working at the same time. That’s where **process states** and **PCB** come in.

---

# 🎯 Step 2: Process States (like moods of a chef)

Imagine a chef cooking food. Depending on the situation, the chef can be in different **moods (states)**:

1. **New 👶**

   * Process is just created.
   * Example: Chef is hired but not started cooking yet.

2. **Ready ✅**

   * Process is ready to run but waiting for CPU.
   * Example: Chef is standing in line, ready to start cooking.

3. **Running 🏃**

   * Process is currently using CPU.
   * Example: Chef is actively cooking a dish.

4. **Waiting ⏳ / Blocked 🚫**

   * Process is waiting for some event (like I/O).
   * Example: Chef is waiting for ingredients (e.g., vegetables from store).

5. **Terminated 💀**

   * Process has finished execution.
   * Example: Chef has cooked and gone home.

(Some OSes also include **Suspended** state: Chef takes a break 💤).

---

# 🎯 Step 3: Process Control Block (PCB) = Chef’s ID Card 🪪

Now the OS must **remember details about each process**.
Think of the PCB as a **detailed ID card or file** about the chef (process).

The PCB contains:

1. **Process ID (PID)** 🆔

   * Unique number to identify the process.

2. **Process State** 🟢🔴

   * New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated.

3. **CPU Registers + Program Counter (PC)** 🧠

   * Where the process left off, so it can resume cooking from same step.

4. **CPU Scheduling Info** ⏱️

   * Priority, queue position.

5. **Memory Info** 🗂️

   * Base and limit registers, memory map (where ingredients are kept).

6. **I/O Status Info** 💾

   * Which files/devices the process is using.

7. **Accounting Info** 🧾

   * CPU time used, process start time, etc.

---

# 🎯 Step 4: Why are States & PCB Important?

* The OS switches between processes using **Context Switching**.
* When it stops one process, it saves its details in the **PCB**.
* Later, it reloads from PCB so the process can continue exactly where it left.

👉 Without PCB, it’s like a chef leaving the kitchen without writing where he stopped → next time he won’t know if the onions are already chopped!

# 🎯 Step 5: Placement-ready Q\&A

💡 **Q1:** What are the main process states in an OS?
👉 New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated.

💡 **Q2:** What is the purpose of a PCB?
👉 PCB stores all information about a process (ID, state, registers, memory, I/O, scheduling info).

💡 **Q3:** How does PCB help in context switching?
👉 It saves the process’s CPU state when switching out, and restores it when switching back.

💡 **Q4:** Is PCB stored in user space or kernel space?
👉 **Kernel space** (because only the OS should manage process details).

⚡ Quick Visual:

* **Process = Chef cooking**
* **State = Chef’s mood (new, ready, running, waiting, finished)**
* **PCB = Chef’s diary/ID card with cooking progress**

⚡ Ajith, these MCQs are at **interview + GATE-level depth**.
Do you want me to now create a **diagram-based question set** (like “Here’s a process state diagram — tell me transitions”)? That’s a common placement trick.
